# EROptimizer
A Project for Optimizing Investment Portfolios by Transitioning from Mutual Funds to Index Funds
##Introduction
OptiFund is designed to optimize investment portfolios by helping users transition from mutual funds to index funds. The project aims to demonstrate that investors can achieve better returns with lower fees and reduced risk by switching to index funds while maintaining their stock-level allocations.


##Motivation
Mutual funds often charge high expense ratios and carry fund manager-specific risks, which can significantly impact long-term returns. Index funds offer lower fees and a more stable investment strategy, typically outperforming mutual funds in the long run. OptiFund helps users seamlessly transition to index funds, ensuring robust investments that yield higher returns without increased sector concentration.


##Features
Easy input of mutual fund investments (relative weights only)
Optimization of investment portfolios using advanced methods
Recommendations for index funds and their respective weights
Performance metrics: overlap, alpha, and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
Continuous monthly monitoring and assessment of the new portfolio


##User Journey
Input Data: Users provide information about their current mutual fund investments. Only the relative weights of the funds are required.
Run Optimization: The optimizer analyzes the input and generates an optimized portfolio of index funds.


##View Results: Users receive recommendations for index funds, along with performance metrics such as overlap, alpha, and HHI.
Continuous Monitoring: The system tracks the performance of the new portfolio monthly and provides updates.


##Future Plans
Future expansions will include additional user constraints such as specific stock or sector allocations, Value at Risk (VaR) limits, and liquidity requirements. Our ultimate aim is to release a commercial version of the optimizer for retail investors and fund managers, enhancing portfolio allocation strategies while addressing individual investment goals and risk profiles.
